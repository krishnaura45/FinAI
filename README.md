## Objectives
The key objectives of Stock Sage are:
- To automate the process of gathering financial news and research from multiple sources.
- To provide accurate and context-aware answers to user queries based on the aggregated news data.
- To optimize costs by minimizing the amount of text provided to the LLM for analysis, thereby reducing API usage.
- To enhance the efficiency and decision-making process of equity analysts by presenting summarized insights from large volumes of text.

## Working
1. **Data Ingestion**: The tool loads financial news articles using LangChain's document loaders.
2. **Text Processing**: News articles are split into smaller chunks using LangChainâ€™s text splitters to ensure that they remain within LLM token limits.
3. **Embeddings and Storage**: Text chunks are converted into embeddings using OpenAI's embeddings API and stored in a vector database (FAISS) for quick retrieval.
4. **Query Processing**: When a user asks a question, the system retrieves relevant text chunks from the vector database and formulates an LLM prompt.
5. **Answer Generation**: The LLM generates an answer, which is returned to the user along with the source of the information.
